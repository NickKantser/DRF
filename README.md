## Installation (For Linux/Mac)
First of all create a virtual environment in the root folder(where is requirements.txt file)
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```
and activate it
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
##### *All the following commands are run from the virtual environment*
After that install all requirements:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Go to the folder where the manage.py file is located and run the following:
```sh
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
Once the migration is done you can run the server:
```sh
python3 manage.py runserver
```

      "nazev": "Barva"
    }
}
